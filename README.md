# trellocc
Getting trello cards on specific boards and playing with awesome trello api.

Trellocc simply gets all the cards from your required list then output to html format. I have included other data for future references who may use this script that may be helpful.

You can run as many configs as you like but make sure that the board id and list you put in your config is correct and most importantly your api key and token.
